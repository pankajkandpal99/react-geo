A React-based web application that allows users to upload KML files, view their contents on a map, and analyze the data with summary and detailed information.

## Features

1. **Upload KML Files**:

   - Users can upload KML files using the file input.
   - The application validates the file type and ensures it is a valid KML file.

2. **Display on Map**:

   - The uploaded KML file is parsed and displayed on an interactive map using **Leaflet.js** and **OpenStreetMap**.

3. **Summary Information**:

   - Users can click the **Summary** button to view a count of different element types (e.g., Point, LineString, Polygon) in the KML file.

4. **Detailed Information**:

   - Users can click the **Detailed** button to view the type and length (for LineStrings and MultiLineStrings) of each element.

5. **Reset Functionality**:

   - The **Reset** button clears the uploaded file, removes the data from the map, and resets all displayed information.

6. **Error Handling**:

   - The application provides clear error messages for invalid file types, empty files, or parsing errors.

7. **User-Friendly UI**:
   - Buttons are disabled when not applicable (e.g., Summary and Detailed buttons are disabled until a file is uploaded).
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects enhance the user experience.
